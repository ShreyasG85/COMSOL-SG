TASKS: 
• 2 Pane window provides massive advantage over 1 Pane window, adding another pane doesn't make much of a difference
• Addition of inductance or resistance in series with resistor gives short response time
• Series-Resistor Parallel-Inductor-Capacitor Circuit generates resonance
• Hall effect and telegraphequations being shown with 2D modelling animation
• 3D Microresistor model 
• Electrochemical and microinductor models incomplete and in progress
• Meisnier effect realised by London Equations
